<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To help minority groups everywhere find a job and company they love</span></p>
<h2>Our Values</h2>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Currently, no career platform meets the needs of minority groups looking for a career. The proposal for Black Cyber Recruiter, by our sponsor Christabel Monica Ugbang Agbonkonkon is groundbreaking and will be a pivotal force that will change the lives of thousands who come from minority groups and as such have a general disadvantage. Black Cyber Recruiter is a platform that not only helps companies to find minority applicants to apply, but focuses on the applicant and enhancing their experience. Black Cyber Recruiter is a one stop location for Black job seekers because the process to apply for jobs is as quick and easy as it can be by providing a valuable and easy to use solution to bridge the gap to help to eliminate job opportunity discrimination.</span></p>
